          <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Green Light Social, located on the West end of 6th Street, is an organic Austin patio bar that has an upscale yet casual vibe with an innovative craft cocktail and beer program. The West 6th entertainment district has rapidly become the predominant night life district for young professionals and socialites of Austin. The district in itself has become branded as a destination and only promises more growth with many residential high-rises and businesses being developed.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>While the story of the Green Light Social has barely begun, the title Green Light has its roots in prohibition. During the prohibition era, “green door” was a common pseudonym for a speakeasy location. Lit or un-lit green lights were used as indicators for a speakeasy’s accessibility. Together, these two prohibition allusions combine to make the adage Green Light, which speaks to the exclusivity of the establishment. In developing the concept of Green Light Social, we envisioned providing a multi-dimensional experience with different yet complimentary atmospheres within the setting.</p>
